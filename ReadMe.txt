Often small utility programs make us more productive and save us from repetitive cumbersome work. 
This is a tool box that consists of small applications that I use on my day-to-day .NET development

• open visual studio command prompt here: open visual studio command prompt from windows explorer
not implemented yet, but to be soon.
