What is it?

A small set of handy features for .NET developers

In command prompt
Open .                 : open windows explorer in a current folder.
Open C:\\program files : open windows explorer in C:\\program files

On windows explorer
Visual Studio 2010 Command Prompt Here : a context menu that opens vs command prompt in the current directory.



The update is that it now follows OS X terminal syntax. 
You can use the same “Open” command to open windows explorer from command prompt. (I discovered “Open .” in OS X terminal pops up Finder)
If you want to open a specific folder, you can put the path. You don’t need to enclose them with quotes(“”).

Hope it helps.
